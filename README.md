### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Davidtmanse/DavidTmanse** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

this is just the first trying to do so!   
Even don't know how to use github to manage my codes.Or use git on vdcode to connet the github so that take code more easy.   
I should spend more time to learn how to use all of them.
